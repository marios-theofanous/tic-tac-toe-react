# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a classic tic-tac-toe game with some styling inspiration from playing on a chalkboard.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Components
### <Game />
This is the main game component. It holds the state and logic of the gameboard and displays the gameboard to the end user. It is the main entry point of the app.

### <Square index={index} value={value} onClick={onClickHandler} />
This is the main Square component of the game. It has styling appropriate for a 3x3 board to make the end result look more like a traditional tic-tac-toe game.

#### Props
##### index (Integer)
This prop allows the component to know its index as part of the bigger board. It is used primarily for testing purposes to create a test id so the game tiles can be selected during testing.

##### value (String)
This prop is the value of the game tile. Usually an "X" or an "O" but can be any String value.

##### onClick (Function) 
This prop is the function to be called when the component is clicked. Can be null if the component is used just for presentation purposes.
